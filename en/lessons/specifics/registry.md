title: Registry
---

The `Registry` module introduced in Elixir 1.4 provides us with a mechanism to look up one or more processes via a given key.  While that may sound a lot like the `name: :genserver_name` option we're familiar with from our [OTP Concurrency](/lessons/advanced/otp-concurrency) lesson there's more — a lot more — to it; if you're not familiar yet the topics outlined in the aforementioned lesson we strongly encourage you to start there.

In this lesson we'll look at what `Registry` is, what it offers us, and how we can use it in our own applications.
